# Frontend Assignment

This is a video player/streamer application where you can:
1.Create, edit and delete videos.
2.Put a video inside a playlist (bucket).
3.Play Videos.
4.See user video history. 

*** CRUD operations will not persist after a reload as resources will not be really updated on the server but they will be faked as if because of JSON placeholder. To persist changes run json-server locally.

## Available Scripts

To run json-server on your local machine:
### `json-server --watch db.json`


To start the app in dev mode you can run the command:
### `npm start`
